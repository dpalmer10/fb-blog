## What is Fantasy Football?

Fantasy Football is a way for fans to engage with the NFL season on a deeper level. It allows fans to create their own team from all players in the NFL and compete against others inside a league ranging from 4 to 32 people. Each week, owners will set a lineup and compete against another member in the league, gaining points based off the performance of the players they started on their team. Owners are able to drop players they own to the waivers, add players off the waivers, and trade players among other members inside the league. Because not all teams make it to the NFL playoffs, often times fantasy leagues will have their playoffs at the end of the NFL regular season, having declared the winner by the last regular season week. Fantasy league commissioners are able to customize nearly everything in the league to their liking, including roster size, custom scoring, playoff format, trade rules,and many other options. To make things competitive, fans sometimes place money into a pot, where the money will be distributed among the top placers, but not all leagues play for money.
