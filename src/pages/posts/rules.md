## Basics
### A game of football is 60 minutes long
* 15 minute long quarters 
* During the 2nd and 4th quarter, the clock stops when 2 minutes remain called the 2 minute warning 
* Teams have 40 seconds after each play ends to start the next play, 25 seconds if referees stop play
* Each teams have 3 timeouts each half
* Team with most points at the end of 4th quarter is the winner, overtime if tied
* At the end of each quarter, teams flip sides of the field

### Start of a Game
* Coin flip to decide who gets the ball first
    * Visiting team decides heads or tails
    * Winner of coin toss can elect to recieve or defer
        * Team that doesn't recieve the ball will recieve the ball 1st in the 2nd half
    * Loser of coin toss decides which direction they want to go
* From the kicking teams own 40 yard line, the kicker kicks the ball to the recieving team
    * Recieving team starts the offense where the kick returner is marked down
        * If the ball is marked down inside the endzone or is kicked out the back of the endzone, team starts on their 25 yard line, called a touchback
        * If the ball is kicked out of bounds, the recieving team starts with the ball 30 yards from the spot of the kick
### Overtime
* Teams redo the coin toss from the beginning of the game
* 15 minute period
    * If score still a tie after 15 minutes, game ends in a draw
        * Game proceeds to an additional overtime period if game is a playoff match
* Both teams get the ball at least once in overtime
    * If a touchdown or a safety is scored on the 1st possession, the game is over. The other team does not get a possession
    * If a field goal is scored on the 1st possession, other team gets the ball
        * If other team fails to score a field goal, or scores a touchdown, the game is over
